Vast swaths of the code base were borrowed from https://github.com/ANDnXOR/ANDnXOR_DC26

I wanted to credit this team / project separately from the header because I didnt want 
them to get blamed for / have my shitty broken code attributed to them. They deserve better
than that. This project would NOT have been possible without them.

The original header that was included in the source files from that project is as follows:
